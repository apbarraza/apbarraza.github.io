# Bio


I am a PhD Research student in the field of computer science, studying at the National University of Ireland, Galway and working at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics. I work under the supervision of Prof. Mathieu d'Aquin.


My current research focuses on analyzing the role of exploration and exploitation in the area of Recommendation Systems. Specifically, I will aim to represent the Recommendation Systems as a reinforcement learning agent that is continuously obtaining information to refine its base knowledge.


I hold a Bachelor in Systems Engineering and a Master in Computer Science from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia.


I first came to work at the Insight Centre as a Master Student Intern in order to carry out my master thesis as a collaborative effort between the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and the Insight Centre. In my master thesis, I worked on the topic of Diversity for Recommender Systems.


My career ambition is to thrive as an Applied Research Scientist working on cutting-edge projects related to the areas I am most passionate about, which include but are not limited to: Recommendation Systems, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
