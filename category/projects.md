## My PhD Research

**Date:** Sep. 2015 – Current 

Recommender Systems (RS) in fast-paced dynamic scenarios must learn to adapt in response to interactive user evaluative feedback. In these settings, the RS faces an online learning problem and must balance two competing goals: exploit the known user model, or explore other preferences the user might have. My research aims to define the role of exploitation and exploration in RS, and propose mechanisms to balance and control this trade-off. The work takes inspiration from the Reinforcement Learning field where balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is key.
